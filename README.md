<h1>Data Science Portfolio by Yoonbo Cho</h1>
This portfolio provides a collection of data analysis or exploration of machine learning algorithms using Jupyter notebook.
<h3>Personal Projects</h3>
<h4>Askreddit Generator Bot</h4>
For this project I created a Bot that generates Askreddit questions, classifies the quality of the question, then with a Bot I posted the question to reddit. Here is the Kernel for this experiment as well as the github for the codes for the ETL, webscraping and the Bot.

<h3>Kaggle Competitions</h3>
<h4>Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster</h4>
This kaggle competition is the research of the infamous sinking of the Titanic. This competition helped me learn how to clean, analyze, and feature engineer in order to produce a optimal classification ML model.

<h3>Personal Studies</h3>
<h4>Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow</h4>
Currently I am working through this particular textbook. Here are my notes written on Jupyter.
