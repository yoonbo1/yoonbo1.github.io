<h3>Personal Projects</h3>
<h4>1. Stock Mock-up Website - Django - Data Visualization</h4>
Using Apis I was able to collect real stock news and implement it onto the website. The website is fully responsive and implements responsive graphs and data visualization using the Chart.Js framework.

<h4>2. Askreddit Generator Bot - TensorFlow</h4>
For this project I created a Bot that generates Askreddit questions, classifies the quality of the question, then with a Bot I posted the question to reddit. Here is the Kernel for this experiment as well as the github for the codes for the ETL, webscraping and the Bot.

<h3>Kaggle Competitions</h3>
<h4>Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster</h4>
This kaggle competition is the research of the infamous sinking of the Titanic. This competition helped me learn how to clean, analyze, and feature engineer in order to produce a optimal classification ML model.
